# Hi there

My name is Connor Kooistra and I am the founder of [Kooistra Cyber Solutions](https://kooistracs.nl).
Additionally, I am currently in my 2nd year of the MSc Computer Security at the [Vrije Universiteit](https://vu.nl).

For my studies I focus on topics such as software security, network security, systems engineering, and secure software development, exploring how to build resilient and robust systems.

As a freelancer, I apply this knowledge directly in projects through my company, where I build robust and secure systems for organizations. For this I mainly use Rust and Python. Recently, Rust has become an essential part of my toolkit for secure systems programming, offering safety, reliability, and performance where it matters most. I am keen and passionate about using my skills to deliver resilient solutions in an increasingly complex field.
